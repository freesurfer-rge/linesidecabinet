    At configuration time, CMake will search for the <a href="http://abyz.me.uk/rpi/pigpio/pigpiod.html">pigpiod library</a>.
    If the library is found, then this constant will be set to `true` and the pigpgiod library will be linked.
    If the library is not available (typical if compilation is not taking place on a Pi), then this will be `false` and set of stubs used in place of the pigpiod library.
    These stubs simply echo their arguments to a stream (which defaults to `std::cout`).
